			    <p style="padding-left: .4em;">My name is Peter Sherk and I am a Senior at North Carolina State University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. Born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, I have always had a deep love and appreciation for the State of North Carolina, and the many incredible opportunities present as a leading technological and cultural hub. My goal in programming is to use as many open source and common code products as possible. I believe sharing information creates a safer and better tech society.
